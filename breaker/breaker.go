// The breaker package provides circuit breaker primitives to enable one to
// safely interact with potentially-unreliable subsystems in a way that allows
// a graceful alternative behavior while in degraded state.
//
// For instance, if your server depends on an external database and it becomes
// unavailable, your server can use a breaker to track these failures and
// provide an alternative workflow during this period of unavailability.
//
// A circuit has two states:
//
// CLOSED: The system decorated with this breaker is assumed to be available
// and the dependents thereof may use it freely.
//
// OPEN: The system decorated with this breaker is assumed to be unavailable
// and the dependents thereof should not use it at this time.
